# OMNeT++ Simulation for Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS)

## üìå Overview
This repository contains OMNeT++ simulation files for evaluating a **statistically driven Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS)** designed for **resource-constrained IoT devices**. The simulation analyzes **network traffic, power consumption, and detection accuracy** to assess the feasibility of deploying an IDPS in IoT environments.

## üõ† Simulation Details
- **Simulation Tool**: OMNeT++  
- **Scenario**: IoT network with multiple nodes  
- **Independent Variables**: Network configuration, attack types, number of iterations, IDPS implementation  
- **Dependent Variables**: Threshold values, power consumption, detection rate  
- **Performance Metrics**: Detection rate, accuracy, precision  

## üîß Installation & Setup
1. **Install OMNeT++** (if not already installed).  
   - Download and install from: [https://omnetpp.org/](https://omnetpp.org/)  
2. **Clone this repository**:
